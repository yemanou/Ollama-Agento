# Development Log

## 2025-10-25 - Code Analysis and Testing

### Analysis Results

**Project Overview:**
- This is a ComfyUI custom node plugin that integrates voice control, screen capture, and AI vision analysis
- Creates a multimodal AI assistant that can analyze screen content via voice commands
- Uses Ollama for local AI inference with vision models (LLaVA)

**Architecture Analysis:**
- **Modular Design**: Three separate nodes for flexibility
  - `ScreenCapture`: Cross-platform screen grabbing using mss library
  - `OllamaVision`: AI vision analysis using Ollama API
  - `VoiceControl`: Speech-to-text using Google Speech Recognition
- **Integration**: Designed to chain together in ComfyUI workflows
- **Dependencies**: External libraries for screen capture, AI inference, and speech recognition

**Code Quality Assessment:**
- ✅ Clean, well-structured ComfyUI node implementation
- ✅ Proper error handling in Ollama and speech recognition
- ✅ Correct tensor/image format conversions for ComfyUI compatibility
- ✅ Modular design allows flexible workflow composition

### Dependency Testing

**Current Status:**
- ✅ `mss` (10.1.0) - Screen capture working
- ❌ `ollama` (0.6.0) - Pydantic compatibility issue detected
- ❌ `SpeechRecognition` - Not installed
- ✅ `PyAudio` (0.2.11) - Audio interface available

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Ollama Dependency**: Version conflict with pydantic.json_schema
2. **Speech Recognition**: Missing SpeechRecognition package
3. **Installation**: Dependencies not installed in ComfyUI environment

### Recommendations

1. **Fix Dependencies**: Update requirements.txt with proper version constraints
2. **Installation Guide**: Add ComfyUI-specific installation instructions
3. **Error Handling**: Add better dependency checking and user feedback
4. **Testing**: Create test workflow examples

## 2025-10-04 - Original Development

### Initial Setup and Core Functionality

-   Created the `ollama_agento` directory to house the custom node.
-   Established the basic ComfyUI node structure with `__init__.py` and `ollama_agento.py`.
-   Created a `requirements.txt` file to list dependencies: `mss` for screen capture, `ollama` for API interaction, and `SpeechRecognition`/`PyAudio` for voice control.
-   Installed dependencies into the system's Python environment.

### Feature Implementation

-   **Screen Capture**: Implemented a `capture_screen` function using the `mss` library to capture the primary monitor.
-   **Ollama Integration**: Added the `ollama` library to send the captured screen and a text prompt to a multimodal model (`llava`). The model's response is returned as a string.
-   **Voice Control**: Implemented a `VoiceControl` node using the `SpeechRecognition` library to capture audio from the microphone and convert it to text.

### Refactoring and Modularization

-   Based on user feedback, the initial monolithic `OllamaAgent` node was refactored into three separate, more modular nodes:
    -   `ScreenCapture`: Solely responsible for capturing the screen.
    -   `OllamaVision`: Handles the interaction with the Ollama API, taking an image and prompt as inputs.
    -   `VoiceControl`: Remains as the dedicated voice-to-text node.
-   This modular design allows for greater flexibility and reusability within ComfyUI workflows.

### Corrections and Documentation

-   Corrected the dependency installation process to target the ComfyUI virtual environment, ensuring the nodes can access the required libraries.
-   Created a `README.md` file with installation instructions and usage examples.
-   Created this `DEV_LOG.md` to document the development process.
